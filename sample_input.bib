title = "Viral histones: pickpocket's prize or primordial progenitor?",
author = "Talbert, Paul B and Armache, Karim-Jean and Henikoff, Steven",
abstract = "The common histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 are the characteristic components of eukaryotic nucleosomes, which function to wrap DNA and compact the genome as well as to regulate access to DNA for transcription and replication in all eukaryotes. In the past two decades, histones have also been found to be encoded in some DNA viruses, where their functions and properties are largely unknown, though recently histones from two related viruses have been shown to form nucleosome-like structures in vitro. Viral histones can be highly similar to eukaryotic histones in primary sequence, suggesting they have been recently picked up from eukaryotic hosts, or they can be radically divergent in primary sequence and may occur as conjoined histone doublets, triplets, or quadruplets, suggesting ancient origins prior to the divergence of modern eukaryotes. Here, we review what is known of viral histones and discuss their possible origins and functions. We consider how the viral life cycle may affect their properties and histories, and reflect on the possible roles of viruses in the origin of the nucleus of modern eukaryotic cells.",

@ARTICLE{Chothia1976-sv,
title = "The nature of the accessible and buried surfaces in proteins",
author = "Chothia, C",
abstract = "The accessible surface areas have been calculated for the individual residues in 12 proteins, and for the extended chains, the secondary structures and tertiary structure of six proteins. The results include the following: 1.(1) The formation of $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-pleated sheets from an extended chain buries a greater proportion of polar surface than non-polar and gives 2 to 3 kcal/mol of hydrophobic free energy per residue. 2.(2) The surfaces buried between the secondary structures are very hydrophobic: being two-thirds non-polar and â€¦",
