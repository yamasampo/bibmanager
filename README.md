# bibmanager

Can insert citekey to "note" field. 


## Future implementation

- Retrieve information from different file format (e.g., JASON, RIS, CSV and so on) and add to BibTex

- Add task controller so that users do not have to look for a script that does a job they want this package to do. Users just need to read this file and specify tasks by flags (like --insert_citekey) and call one script.
